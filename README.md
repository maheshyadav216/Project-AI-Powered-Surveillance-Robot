Using embedded Vision AI for Street violence's detection and Detecting suspicious peoples carrying weapons.  

👮 Surveillance and patrolling robots are increasingly being used in various sectors for security and monitoring purposes. These robots can operate autonomously or semi-autonomously and are equipped with various sensors and technologies to perform their tasks effectively.  

🚩 Problem Statement :  
Terrorism is a global problem that affects people of all ages, races, and religions. It is important to remember the victims of terrorism and to work to prevent future attacks. It is estimated that over 57,000 people have been killed in terrorist attacks since 2001. This number is likely higher, as many attacks go unreported or are not properly documented.  

In India, 2008 Mumbai attacks, 10 Armed militant entered into Hotel, Railway Station, Hospital and other crowdy places and killed 175 peoples, and injured more than 300.  

What if we could quickly detect suspicious peoples carrying guns when they landed on beach? We would have definitely saved a lot of lives.    

💡 Proposed Solution :  
I want to build AI and Deep learning based Surveillance/patrolling Robot with 360 degree PTZ and HD cameras mounted on it, which will move around in these places (like Bus, Railway, Tram, Subway Stations, Airports and other public places) autonomously and (with use of Deep learning and AI video analytics Techniques) to keep looking for “Suspicious activities like People carrying weapons, Guns etc” and warn the security personals for any such sightings.  

I want to train and make this robot Smart enough, so that it can identify Suspicious activities like People carrying weapons, identifying violent individuals. It should also be able to identify and differentiate between security personals and possible threat. This robot will also provide information and Warning signal the authorities about any sightings of Wanted Criminals who’s blacklisted by Police, (criminal database training should be done before).
